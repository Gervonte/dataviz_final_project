# Data Visualization and Reproducible Research

> Gervont√© Fowler. 


The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find an exploration of the evolution of musical characteristics in Billboard summer hits from 1958 to the present. Using data visualization techniques in R, the analysis focuses on key audio features such as danceability, energy, valence, and musical key. The goal is to uncover long-term trends in the emotional tone and rhythmic structure of popular summer music, providing insights into how mainstream music has shifted in response to cultural, technological, and industry changes.
